            Our mission is to foster a united community where individuals can
            come together to actively support and locate missing persons of
            color. We provide a dedicated platform that empowers users to share
            information, raise awareness, and collaborate in the search efforts.
            Through our app, we strive to bridge the gap, amplify the voices,
            and ensure that every missing person of color is given the attention
            and resources they deserve. Together, we aim to bring hope,
            facilitate connections, and reunite families.

          In today's media landscape, a profound disparity in coverage regarding missing persons has become evident. Despite tens of thousands of reported missing individuals, only a fraction of these cases receive substantial press attention. Critics argue that the media exhibits a tendency to prioritize attractive, young white women, thereby neglecting the cases of missing women who belong to marginalized groups based on race, age, body size, or non-conventional attractiveness. This media bias highlights an alarming manifestation of racism and systemic discrimination, contributing to the perpetuation of inequity within our society.
          <br />
          <br />
          Cases such as that of Gabby Petito exemplify the phenomenon known as "missing white woman syndrome," where disproportionate media coverage detracts attention and resources from other cases, particularly those involving individuals of color. It is of utmost importance that we address and challenge these biases, actively striving for equal and unbiased media coverage for all missing persons, irrespective of their race or physical appearance.
