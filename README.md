## Product Overview 
Our platform is a dedicated website that serves as a helpful tool for locating missing persons of color. It provides a user-friendly interface where individuals can access essential tools and resources to actively contribute to the search efforts. Users can share vital information, such as descriptions, last known locations, and photographs, to help raise awareness and increase the chances of finding the missing individuals. The website also helps collaboration among community members, enabling them to coordinate search parties, organize events, and provide support to the families affected.

## Summary 
Our platform addresses the urgent need to address the inconsistency in media coverage, resource allocation, and community support for missing persons of color, particularly focusing on the alarming rates of missing and murdered Indigenous women. Statistics reveal the severity of the issue, with the National Crime Information Center reporting 5,712 cases of missing American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls, while the U.S. Department of Justice missing persons database only reported 116 cases. Despite these staggering numbers, data collection remains challenging due to poor record-keeping, underreporting, racial misclassification, and limited media coverage. Our platform aims to address these issues by actively involving the community, sharing crucial information, and fostering connections to bridge the gap between missing Indigenous individuals and their families.
